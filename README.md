# Crop-Price-Prediction-using-Random-Forest-ML
This project demonstrates the use of Random Forest Regression to predict crop prices based on key agricultural features. The web application, built with Flask, allows users to upload their datasets and visualize the model's predictions through metrics like RÂ², Mean Squared Error (MSE), and a scatter plot comparing actual vs. predicted values.
